= Introduction

This document presents a proposal for one possible control interface for the Trace Encoder described in the _RISC-V Processor Trace_ Specification Version 1.0 and for the RISC-V Nexus Trace specification now in progress. A number of participants in both Trace Working Groups have expressed a desire to standardize the control interface so that software development tools can be used interchangeably with any compliant RISC-V device. This document is intended as a starting point for discussions, not as a final specification.

Instruction Trace is a system that collects a history of processor execution, along with other events. The trace system is set up and controlled using a register-based interface. Core execution activity appears on the Ingress Port and feeds into a Trace Encoder where it is compressed and formatted into trace messages. The Trace Encoder transmits trace messages to a Trace Sink. In multi-core systems, each core has its own Trace Encoder, and typically all will connect to a Trace Funnel that aggregates trace data from multiple sources and sends the data to a single destination.

This proposal does not define the hardware interconnection between the core and Trace Encoder, as this is defined in the _RISC-V Processor Trace Specification_. This proposal also does not define the hardware interconnection between the Trace Encoder and Trace Funnel, or between the Trace Encoder/Funnel and Trace Sink since it is expected that these components are all part of a system provided by a single vendor.

This proposal allows a wide range of implementations including low-gate-count minimal instruction trace and systems with only instrumentation trace. Implementation choices include whether to support branch trace, data trace, instrumentation trace, timestamps, external triggers, various trace sink types, and various optimization tradeoffs between gate count, features, and bandwidth requirements.

= Control Interface

The Trace Encoder control interface consists of a set of 32-bit registers occupying up to a 4K-byte space. The control interface is used to set up and control a trace session, retrieve collected trace history, and control any trace system components embedded in or directly connected to a Trace Encoder.

The Trace Encoder control registers would typically be accessed by a debugger through the debug module. The Trace Encoder may or may not also be accessible through loads and stores performed by one or more harts in the system. Typically, the Trace Encoder connects to the system bus as a peripheral device, but it may use a dedicated bus connection from the Debug Module, or could attach to the DMI bus defined in the RISC-V Debug Specification.

Additional control path(s) may also be implemented, such as a dedicated debug bus or message-passing network.

Mapping the control interface into physical memory accessible from a hart allows that hart to manage a trace session independently from an external debugger. A hart may act as an internal debugger or may act in cooperation with an external debugger. Two possible use models are collecting crash information in the field and modifying trace collection parameters during execution. If a system has physical memory protection (PMP), a range can be configured to restrict access to the trace system from hart(s).

There is typically one Trace Encoder per core. A core with multiple harts (i.e., multi-threaded) will generate messages with a field indicating which hart is responsible for that message. Cores capable of retiring more than one instruction per cycle are typically accommodated with a single Trace Encoder, though this is not required.

The Trace Funnel is a variant of the Trace Encoder and shares many of the same control registers. Each Trace Encoder and the Trace Funnel has its own set of control registers in its own register block.

== Register Map

The 4K block occupied by a Trace Encoder or Trace Funnel is divided into eight sections of 256 bytes. Section 0 is required and is used for local control registers. Other sections are used for control registers of trace components that are conceptually separate, even if they are physically part of the Trace Encoder/Funnel. Examples of possible subcomponents are:

* PC Sampling
* Filtering
* Instrumented Trace
* Additional Sink Types

Registers in the 4K range that are not implemented read as 0 and ignore writes.

= Trace Encoder Introduction

This section briefly describes features of the Trace Encoder (TE) as background for understanding some of the control interface register fields.

== Trace Encoder Types

By monitoring the Ingress Port, the TE determines when a program flow discontinuity has occurred and whether the discontinuity is inferable or non-inferable. An inferable discontinuity is one for which the Trace Decoder can statically determine the destination, such as a direct branch instruction in which the destination or offset is included in the opcode. Non-inferable discontinuities include all other types â€“ interrupt, exception, and indirect jump instructions.

== Branch Trace Messaging

Branch Trace Messaging is the simplest form of trace. Each discontinuity results in one trace message, either a Direct or Indirect Branch Message.

Indirect Branch Messages normally contain a compressed address to reduce bandwidth. The TE emits a Branch With Sync Message containing the complete instruction address under certain conditions. This message type is a variant of the Direct or Indirect Branch Message and includes a full address and a field indicating the reason for the Sync.

NOTE: RC: Change to more 'generic' (Branch Packet? Simple?)

== Branch History Messaging

Both the RISC-V Processor Trace Specification and the Nexus standard define systems of messages intended to improve compression by reporting only whether conditional branches are taken and the destinations of non-inferable jumps and calls. Much better compression can be achieved, but an Encoder implementation will typically require more hardware.

NOTE: RC: Change to more 'generic' (Branch BitMap/BitFlow, FlowBitMap?)

== Other Optimizations

Several other optimizations are possible to improve trace compression. These are optional for any Trace Encoder and there should be a way to disable optimizations in case the trace system is used with code that does not follow recommended API rules. Examples of optimizations are a Return-address stack, Branch repetition, Statically-inferable jump, and Branch prediction.

NOTE: RC: Change to more 'generic' (Advanced?) - maybe we should 'map' several levels to Nexus (BTM=Branch Trace Messages/HTM=Branch History Messages). We could find 'common denominator' and also allow 'encoder-specific'

== Trace Sinks

The Trace Encoder transmits completed messages to a Trace Sink. This proposal defines a number of different sink types, all optional, and allows an implementation to define other sink types. A Trace Encoder must have at least one sink.

=== SRAM Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words. These are then stored in a RAM, typically located on-chip, in a circular-buffer fashion. When the RAM has filled, the TE may optionally allow trace to be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace.

NOTE: RC: 'fixed-width trace words' - should not we talk about 'packet is sequence of bytes'?

=== PIB Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to the PIB Sink. Each message is transmitted off-chip using a specific protocol described later.

=== System Memory (SBA) Sink

The Trace Encoder packs trace messages into fixed-width trace words. These are then stored in a range of system memory reserved for trace using a DMA-type bus master in a circular-buffer fashion. When the memory range has been filled, the TE may optionally allow trace to be stopped, or it may wrap and overwrite earlier trace. This type of sink may also be used to transmit trace off-chip through, for example, a PCIe or USB port.

NOTE: RC: Again - packet is sequence of bytes?

=== ATB Sink

The ATB Sink transmits bytes of trace messages as an ATB bus master.

NOTE: RC: ATB has width, which is either 8 or 32-bit (again - should not we limit to 'packet=sequence-of-bytes' definition? In case we have other width say 10-bits, these still cab be considered as bytes with 4 MSB=0).

=== Funnel Sink

The Trace Encoder sends trace messages to a Trace Funnel. The Funnel aggregates trace from each of its inputs and sends the combined trace stream to its designated Trace Sink, which is one or more of the sink types above.

NOTE: RC: It is assumed, that each input to funnel has 'SRC' defined (this is te)

= Trace Encoder Register Interface

Most features of the Trace Encoder are optional. In most cases, optional features are enabled using a WARL (write any, read legal) register field. A debugger can determine if an optional feature is present by writing to the register field and reading back the result.

NOTE: RC: E-Trace defines (table 2.1). 'Active'  is same as 'teActive'. As it is enabling of single ENCODER only 'teActive' seems better name.

NOTE: RC: Single 'teTracing' is split into 'iTracing' and 'dTracing'.

NOTE: RC: Names 'stallEnable', while 'teStallEnable'. In general it would be good to define two iStall/dStall. It is OK to 'drop data' (sometimes ...), while PC being lost is harder to accomodate.

NOTE: RC: E-Trace defines ReSyncMode/ReSyncMax (3 modes), while Nexus has two fields (E-Trace is better).

NOTE: RC: E-Trace defines 'vector' of encoder options/features (table 2.2).

NOTE: RC: Nexus has 3-bit field logically providing 3 BTM/HTM/HTM+callstack instruction tracing levels.

*RC-PROPOSAL (teFeatures)*

teImpl.version=0 - Define 8 levels (0 .. 7) of instruction trace.

    E-Trace may NEVER implement these levels (only teFeatures)

teImpl.version=1 - Allows (optional):

    B7=1    - if set, trace is  controlled by 'teFeatures' register. 
            - Setting bits B4-B6 may make 'teFeature' read-only and
            reflect pre-defined set of features.

Alternative:

    B4-B6   - Value 7 defines 'Full Instruction Trace', which can be trimmed by 'teNoFeature' (0=all features allowed)

NOTE: RC: E-Trace table 2.2 defines 9 featues for both instruction (6) and data (4) trace. I would define 12 bits for 'instruction-trace' + 12 for 'data-trace' and 8 as 'reserved'

    B0..B11     - Up to 12 I-trace features
    B12..B15    - Reserved
    B16..B27    - Up to 12 D-trace features
    B28-B31     - Reserved

Some bits may be common (like call/return skipping?) and may occupy LSB bits. Both E-Trace and 'Nexus-Trace' should define these bits.

|===

NOTE: RC: Add 64-bit extensions as 32 MSB bits of size (reading 3 times is needed to be certain about 64-bit value). In order to relieve trace software to read 3 times always, there should be a field/bit saying if RAM size over 32-bit is implemented. It may be also WARL field, which must be set to '1' in order to allow 64-bit size. In most cases, it will never be settable (as 4GB or RAM for trace is rare requirement)

= Timestamp Unit

Timestamp is an optional feature. An implementation may choose from several types of timestamp unit: Internal, External, Slave, or Vendor-specific. Implementations may have no timestamp, one timestamp type, or more than one type. The WARL field tsType is used to determine the system capability and to set the desired type.

* Internal uses a fixed system clock to increment the timestamp counter
* Slave mode accepts a timestamp broadcast from another Trace Encoder
* External accepts a binary timestamp value from an outside source such as ARM CoreSight(TM) trace
* The width of the timestamp is implementation-dependent

An Internal Timestamp Unit may include a prescale divider, which can extend the range of a narrower timestamp and uses less power but has less resolution.

In a single-hart system with an Internal Timestamp counter, it may be desirable to stop the counter when the hart is halted by a debugger. An optional control bit is provided for this purpose. Most other control bits are also optional. A debugger may determine the specific capabilities by writing and reading back a WARL register field.

NOTE: RC: Timestamp is more elaborated in Nexus-Trace.

The TE may be configured with up to 8 external trigger inputs for controlling trace. These are in addition to the external triggers present in the Debug Module when Halt Groups are implemented. The specific hardware signals comprising an external trigger are implementation-dependent.

External Trigger Outputs may also be present. A trigger out may be generated by trace starting, trace stopping, a watchpoint, or by other system-specific events.

= Core Watchpoints

Watchpoints are signals from the core that a breakpoint was hit, but the action associated with that breakpoint is a trace-related action. Action identifiers 2-5 are reserved for trace actions in the RISC-V Debug Spec, where breakpoints are defined. Actions 2-4 are defined by the RISC-V Processor Trace Spec. The desired action is written to the action field of the mcontrol CSR (0x7a1). Not all cores support trace actions; the debugger should read back mcontrol after setting one of these actions to verify that the option exists.

If there are vendor-specific features that require control, the wpControl register is used.

It is implementation-dependent what happens when watchpoints or external triggers with conflicting actions occur simultaneously or if watchpoints or external triggers occur too frequently to process.

= Trace Funnel

NOTE: RC: This is generic concept. It should be extended to see what TE[s] are connected to particular funnel (read-only bit in TE register settable by funnel register or other way around ...)

The Trace Funnel combines messages from multiple sources into a single trace stream. The Funnel has the same options for sinks as a single Trace Encoder which are controlled by the same registers as described above. It is implementation-dependent how many incoming messages are accepted per cycle and in what order.

= PIB Trace Sink

NOTE: RC: This is generic - all is required is byte-stream.

NOTE: RC: It is undefined what is 'idle-byte' for E-Trace. External trace operates on 'continous-clock'.

Trace data may be sent to chip pins through an interface called the Pin Interface Block (PIB). This interface typically operates at a few hundred MHz and can sometimes be higher with careful constraints and board layout or by using LVDS or other high-speed signal protocol. PIB may consist of just one signal and in this configuration may be called SWT (Serial-wire Trace). Alternative configurations include a trace reference clock and between 1 and 8 trace data signals timed to that reference. WARL register fields are used to determine specific PIB capabilities.

The modes and behavior described here are intended to be compatible with trace probes available in the market.

== Calibration Mode

In optional calibration mode, the PIB transmits a repeating pattern. Probes can use this to automatically tune input delays due to skew on different PIB signal lines and to adjust to the transmitter's data rate. The suggested patterns for each mode are listed here.

== SWT Manchester Protocol

In this mode, the PIB outputs complete trace messages encapsulated between a start bit and a stop bit. Each bit period is divided into 2 phases and the sequential values of the tdata[0] pin during those 2 phases denote the bit value. Bits of the message are transmitted LSB first. The idle state of tdata[0] is low in this mode.

== SWT UART Protocol

In UART protocol, the PIB outputs bytes of a trace message encapsulated in a 10-bit packet consisting of a low start bit, 8 data bits, LSB first, and a high stop bit. Another packet may begin immediately following the stop bit or there may be an idle period between packets. When no data is being sent, tdata[0] is high in this mode.

image:./RISC-V-Trace-Control-Interface-images/swt-uart.jpg[image]

== PIB Parallel Protocol

Traditionally, off-chip trace has used this protocol. There are a number of parallel data signals and one continuously-running clock reference. The data rate of several parallel signals can be much higher than either of the serial-wire protocols.

As with SWT modes, this protocol is oriented to full trace messages rather than fixed-width trace words. The idle state of tdata is all-ones for Nexus trace and (TBD) for RISC-V Processor Trace. When a message start is detected, this sample and possibly the next few (depending on the width of tdata) are collected until a complete byte has been received. Bytes are transmitted LSB first, with tdata[0] representing the LSB in each beat of data. The receiver continues collecting bytes until a complete message has been received. The criteria for this depends on the trace format. For Nexus, the last byte of a message is one that has mseo=1,1. For RISC-V Processor Trace, the header byte includes a byte count. After the last byte of a message, the data signals may then go their idle state or a new message may begin in the next bit period.

NOTE: RC: Here we should provide example of two messages back-to-back and with idle[s] in between. For both Nexus-Trace and 'suggested' for E-Trace. As E-Trace suggests message to start from counter, idle message may be some reserved encoding (1 or more bytes).

NOTE: RC: For both cases, there is no definition of main synchronization ... (also needed for wrapped-around RAM captures) as packet boundary is unknown. Nexus-trace is self-sync, but E-Trace may not be.

The clock reference, tref, normally has edges coincident with the tdata edges. Typically, a trace probe will use a PLL to recover a sampling clock that is twice the frequency of tref and shifted 90 degrees so that its rising edges occur near the center of each bit period. If the PIB implementation supports it, the debugger can set pibRefCenter to change the timing of tref so that there is a tref edge at the center of each bit period on tdata. Note that this option cuts the data rate in half relative to normal parallel mode and still requires the probe to sample tdata on both edges of tref.

This example shows 8-bit parallel mode with pibRefCenter=0 transmitting a 5-byte message followed by a 2-byte message.

= ATB Trace Sink

Some SoCs may have an Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) infrastructure to manage trace produced by other components. In such systems, it is feasible to route RISC-V trace output to the ATB through an ATB Trace Sink. This module manages the interface to ATB, generating ATB trace records that encapsulate RISC-V trace produced by the TE. There is a control register that includes trace on/off control and a field allowing software to set the DeviceID to be used on the ATB. This DeviceID allows software to extract RISC-V trace from the combined trace. This interface is compatible with AMBA 4 ATB v1.1.
